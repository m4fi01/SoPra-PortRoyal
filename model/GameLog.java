/**
 * GameLog is a data container that implements a history of game state represented by Game-objects. Since an instance of
 * GameLog contains all the necessary information about the game states, it can serve as a suitable representation of a
 * single game of Port Royal. To provide a basis for implementing undo and redo functionality at controller level,
 * get-methods for the previous, current and next game state are provided, as well as the possibility to add new game
 * states to this history while ensuring the consistency of the history.
 * <p>
 * In addition, GameLog and all classes used in it implements the Serializable-interface, which allows the current game
 * of Port Royal to be stored by serialising the GameLog-object that represents it.
