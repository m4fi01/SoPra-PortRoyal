/**
 * Player is a data container that contains all the information needed to represent a player during a single game of
 * Port Royal. It supports a unique identification number that allows multiple players with the same name at the same
 * time, and provides methods for managing all the cards a player holds during a match by supporting appropriate add and
 * remove functionality.
 * <p>
 * Player implements the Serializable-interface to allow the current game of Port Royal to be stored by serialising the
 * GameLog-object that represents it.
